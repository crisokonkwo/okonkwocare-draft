    'quote' => 'Dr. Okonkwo has been our daughter\'s pediatrician since she was born 3 months ago and I am so grateful we chose her! Her bedside manner is impeccable, she is kind, patient, and highly knowledgeable. I appreciate her focus on holistic health rather than simply treating a symptom. As a first-time parent, I also love that we can reach her directly via text and get quick responses to our questions and concerns. Her office space is welcoming and warm. We never have to wait to see her and she spends one hour minimum with us during our daughter\'s wellness visits and doesn\'t make us feel rushed. I feel this is a rare and unique experience for a doctor\'s visit in Miami.<br><br>I highly recommend Dr. Okonkwo to anyone looking for a pediatrician.',

    'quote' => 'Dr. Okonkwo has been my daughters pediatrician for over 10 years and now is caring for my son as well. Although, direct to consumer medical practices are a newer concept, Doctor Okonkwo is really setting the bar quite high for other practices to follow suit.<br><br>Her level of care for both my children as well as follow up, is like nothing I\'ve ever experienced before. She takes the time to get to know both you and the kids which then leads to overall better patient care.<br><br>I can\'t recommend her enough - she is well worth it!',

    'quote' => 'Dr. Okonkwo has been my 11 year old and 5 year old\'s doctor since they were born. She is an excellent doctor who takes her time with each of them. We love Okonkwo Care and the set up. When my son got sick she was immediately right there on the phone speaking to me and my husband about it. We were sending her text messages each morning to give her updates on his status and she replied right away with advise on what to do and look out for. It was like having a family member as your doctor! No crowded office waiting rooms, no waiting on hold to get an appointment, no logging into a website to schedule a sick visit. We were getting medical advice while my son was lying in his bed resting. When she needed to see him in person, we didn\'t have to carry him into a full waiting room and sit for hours waiting to be seen. We set up a convenient time directly with her and went to her office which is comfortable and beautifully and peacefully decorated. My children love visiting her office and telling her all about themselves. <br><br>Above all, Dr. Okonkwo is really passionate about giving the best medical care to her patients. Her dedication is remarkable. We are lucky to have her as our children\'s doctor.',
