          <p class="mt-2 text-sm leading-6 text-slate-700">
            Managing your child's ADHD or attention problems can feel like a frustrating challenge. 
            Dr. Okonkwo, Functional Medicine ADHD certified, offers help with a holistic, functional 
            medicine approach to treating ADHD, addressing root causes instead of merely managing symptoms. 
            This perspective, grounded in functional medicine, views ADHD as a multifaceted condition influenced 
            by neurobiological, environmental, genetic, nutritional, and lifestyle factors.
            <br /><br />
            Targeted testing identifies contributing factors to a patient's symptoms. Treatment strategies restore 
            equilibrium based on those specific factors. Personalized treatment plans remain essential, as each 
            patient's symptoms and contributing factors prove unique.
            <br /><br />
            This journey includes a 6-month plan to identify and address ADHD causes. It follows a step-wise approach 
            tailored to each individual patient, with specific testing and treatment plans implemented each month. 
            Upon completing the six-month program, we recommend continuing care via membership in the holistic ADHD 
            program to support your child's ongoing success in managing ADHD.
            <br /><br />
            This holistic, functional medicine approach empowers children with ADHD and their families to take an 
            active role in their healing journey, with potential to reduce or eliminate medication needs.
